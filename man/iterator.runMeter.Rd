\title{Run features for a single meterId}
\usage{
iterator.runMeter(meterId, custFn, ctx, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{meterId}{The meterId to use to instantiate a \code{MeterDataClass} object}

\item{custFn}{The feature extraction function(s) to run on the instance of \code{MeterDataClass}. 
If it is a list of feature functions, the results will be \code{c()}'d together, so make sure the names of their 
return values are unique!}

\item{ctx}{The ctx environment for the feature extraction.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the feature extraction function.}
}
\description{
Utility function that runs the configured set of feature functions on a single passed 
meter. This is useful for testing and feature development, but also as the function 
called by parallelizable methods like apply, and the *ply function of plyr to run feature
extraction in on multiple cores of a computer.
